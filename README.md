## New Slack Channel Notifications Built with Slack's Automation Platform

This example demonstrates how to build a "standard" (=free) workflow that sends notifications whenever a new channel is created.

## Getting Started

### Install Slack CLI

If you are not yet familiar with Slack's Automation platform, I suggest visiting its website to gain an understanding of it: https://api.slack.com/automation To run this app, you must install [the Slack CLI](https://api.slack.com/automation/quickstart) and follow the steps using the `slack login` command.

### Clone this template

Run `slack create -t https://github.com/seratch/slack-new-channel-notification` to clone this template:

```
$ slack create -t https://github.com/seratch/slack-new-channel-notification
‚öôÔ∏è  Creating a new Slack app in ~/tmp/jolly-turtle-321

üì¶ Installed project dependencies

‚ú® jolly-turtle-321 successfully created

üß≠ Explore the documentation to learn more
   Read the README.md or peruse the docs over at api.slack.com/automation
   Find available commands and usage info with slack help

üìã Follow the steps below to begin development
   Change into your project directory with cd jolly-turtle-321/
   Develop locally and see changes in real-time with slack run
   When you're ready to deploy for production use slack deploy

$ cd jolly-turtle-321/
```

### Set a valid channel ID to notify new channels

Create a new channel to post notifications and copy its channel ID:

Replace the channel ID in `workflows/new_channel_notification.ts` as below:

<img src="https://github.com/seratch/slack-new-channel-notification/assets/19658/bd4ad6d2-9b5f-4ca3-8c40-6b49f72ed231" width=600 />

If you want to customize the notification message, you can edit the "message" parameter as well.

If you're an Enterprise Grid customer, you must pass `team_ids` in the trigger definition alongside the channel ID. For more details, please refer to the comment in the code.

### Deploy the app

Now that the app is prepared for deployment, you can run `slack deploy` command. You will be asked to create a trigger. Don't skip creating it. If you fail to create it for some reason, you can do the same with `slack trigger create --trigger-def triggers/channel_created_event.ts`.

```
$ slack deploy
? Choose a deployed environment Install to a new team
? Install to a new team seratch T03E*****

üîî If you leave this team, you can no longer manage the installed apps
   Installed apps will belong to the team if you leave the workspace

üìö App Manifest

‚ö° Create a trigger

Whenever someone creates a new public channel, the channel receives a notification like this!

To customize the app name and icon, you can modify `manifest.ts` and add your own icon image file within the `assets/` directory.

That's it! :tada: As long as you refrain from adding custom steps to this workflow, Slack's automation platform won't charge addition cost for it. For more information, kindly refer to [the help page](https://slack.com/help/articles/15363357403411).

Enjoy automating anything!
